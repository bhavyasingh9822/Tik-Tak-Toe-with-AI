# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game where one player is the user and the other player is an AI powered by the Minimax algorithm. The game is designed in HTML/CSS and JavaScript programming language and provides an interactive experience for playing Tic Tac Toe against an intelligent opponent.

# Features:
**Minimax Algorithm**: The AI player employs the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring that it plays at the highest possible level.
**Interactive Interface**: The game provides a user-friendly interface for playing Tic Tac Toe, allowing the user to make moves by selecting the desired position on the board.
**Winning Detection**: The game detects winning combinations and announces the winner at the end of each round.
**Draw Detection**: In case no player wins, the game detects a draw and notifies the players accordingly.

# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the file in your preferred environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Execute the script to start the Tic Tac Toe game.
Follow the prompts to make your moves and play against the AI.
Enjoy the game!
# Minimax Algorithm:
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player games with perfect information, such as Tic Tac Toe. It evaluates possible moves by recursively simulating the game until a terminal state (win, lose, or draw) is reached. The algorithm aims to minimize the maximum possible loss (hence the name "Minimax") and ensures that the AI player makes optimal moves.

# Note:
This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the implementation of the Minimax algorithm in a game scenario.
The code is well-commented and structured for easy understanding and customization.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the game or experiment with different strategies.
